-- Monthly Reports --
---------------------

In order to help coordinate, inspire and move forward every one should
towards the end of each month post a message to the gnavi-discuss list
with a small summary of current work on the GNAVI project. This
includes when possible even students and end users that are working
on code that uses GNAVI. Excitement breads excitement!
